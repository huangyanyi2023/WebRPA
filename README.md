# WebRPA
WebRPA is a Python-based project that combines web scraping, automation, and robotic process automation (RPA) techniques. It provides a set of tools and utilities to automate repetitive web-based tasks, such as data entry, form filling, and report generation. The project aims to simplify the process of automating web workflows and increasing productivity.

## Features

- Web scraping: Extract data from websites using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup and requests.
- Automation: Automate web interactions, such as form filling, clicking, scrolling, and data extraction, using the Selenium library.
- RPA capabilities: Perform repetitive tasks and automate business processes on web applications.
- Easy configuration: The project provides a simple API and configuration file for defining automation workflows.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/huangyanyi2023/WebRPA.git


2. Install the required dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Download the appropriate web driver for your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

1. Configure the automation workflow by editing the `config.py` file. Specify the target website URL, the actions to perform, and any additional settings.

2. Run the `web_rpa.py` script:

python web_rpa.py


The script will launch a web browser, perform the specified actions on the target website, and generate the desired output.

3. Customize the automation workflow in the `web_rpa.py` script based on your specific requirements. Use the provided functions and methods to interact with web elements, extract data, and perform actions.

```python
from web_rpa import WebRPA

rpa = WebRPA()

# Example: Fill out a form
rpa.fill_form('https://www.example.com/form', {'name': 'John Doe', 'email': 'john@example.com'})

# Example: Click on a button
rpa.click_button('https://www.example.com/button')

# Example: Extract data from a table
table_data = rpa.extract_table_data('https://www.example.com/table')

# Customize the automation workflow based on your requirements.
